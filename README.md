Episode VI: The sentients (RPC autonomously communicating server-client)


Captain's log:
As we stray deeper into the machine inner conversation. Here we have a first taste of the real API power as we create to little programs that talk to each other. This is made through RPG as opposed to REST... how is it different? Well I know one or two things... but this is only the tip. As for today we are just getting to it, and we will soon tame it... soon...
